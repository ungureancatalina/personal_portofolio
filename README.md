## Personal Portfolio

This Personal Portfolio website showcases a curated collection of academic and personal projects that demonstrate practical skills, creativity, and continuous self-driven learning. It highlights my commitment to applying theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges, exploring innovative solutions, and expanding my expertise through hands-on experience and personal initiative.

The portfolio features an interactive and visually engaging layout where projects float and rotate in a circular pattern, allowing easy navigation and access to each project’s GitHub repository.
